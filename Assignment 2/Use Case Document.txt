1. Use Case Name: Control the input pumps.
2. Scope: Buffer tank level control system.
3. Level: User goal
4. Primery Actor: Input pumps.
5. Interests: Control system user and management of the plant.
6. Preconditions: Prefered liquid level must be set to a value.
7. Success Garantee: Input pumps setting changed to a new setting proportional to the output pumps setting and the relation between the current and prefered liquid level.
8. Main Success Scenario:
	1. Control system collects data on current liquid levels.
    2. Control system request current pump settings
    3. Pumps give current pump settings
	4. Control system determins pumps new settings.
	5. Control system sends adjusted input pumps settings.
    6. Control system requests pumps new settings.
    7. Pumps send new settings.
9. Extension:
	1A. Check displayed level if memory of level has been corrupted
	2A. Reestablish connection to pumps if connection is broken.
    3B. Request new pump settings if recieved settings are ouside of pumps capabilities
	4A. Display a warning if input settings are already at max but current liquid level is sinking below prefered level.
	4B. Display a warning if input settings are already at min but current liquid level is sinking above prefered level.
	5A. Reestablish with pumps if pumps are no longer connected
    7A. Reconnect with pump if a pump is not changing its setting to the one requested.
	7B. Display warning if pump is not changing setting after reconnection.
10. Special Requirements: 
11. Technology and Data variation list: 
12. Frequency of occurence:
	Every time output pumps settings are changed
	Every time an alarm goes off
	Every ten minutes it hasen't been called
13. Misc:
